- 👋 Hi, I’m @BetweenSkies
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code so I can switch careers. I'm currently doing digital marketing and I hate it! So I'm doing something about it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but I also want to learn Java, Javascript, Go, C, C# & SQL in the future!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with more experienced programmers for fun, and get advice on how to break into the industry.
- 📫 How to reach me: timothyjamesdickinson@gmail.com
